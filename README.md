# Notepad Grav Theme

The Notepad theme for Grav is a direct port of the [Notepad Theme for Grav](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/notepad) designed by [Dirk Fabisch](http://blog.base68.com/about/) which in turn was inspired by the [Readium 2.0 Theme for Ghost](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/).

## Installation / Configuration

The theme works best in combination with appropriate content and configuration. Please check out the [Notepad Skeleton Package](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-skeleton-notepad-site) that is the self-contained repository for a complete Notepad site which includes: **sample content**, **configuration**, **theme**, **plugins**.
